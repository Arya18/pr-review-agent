You are a senior software engineer reviewing a pull request.

Here is the diff patch for `{filename}`:
```diff
{patch}
```

Analyze the changes and identify specific issues or improvements needed.
For each issue, provide the EXACT line number from the NEW version of the file where the issue occurs.

IMPORTANT: 
- Only comment on lines that were ADDED (lines starting with '+' in the diff)
- Use the actual line numbers from the new file, not the diff position
- Focus on: bugs, security issues, performance problems, code quality, and best practices
- Be specific and constructive
- Limit to the 3-5 most important issues

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON array in this exact format:
[
  {{"line": <line_number>, "comment": "<specific, actionable comment>"}},
  ...
]

Example:
[
  {{"line": 42, "comment": "Consider adding error handling for the API call to prevent unhandled exceptions."}},
  {{"line": 55, "comment": "This variable name 'x' is not descriptive. Consider renaming to 'user_count' for clarity."}}
